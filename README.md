These are an example of the work that I have done on my most recent project

## SQl Mile Radius Proceudre
This procedure I wrote in MSSQL is a procedure that grabs all of the jobs in the user's ten mile radius. I did a procedure for
a twenty and thirty mile radius as well. The procedure grabs the current user's zipcode and makes it a geography point. Then it grabs
the data from the job posts table and any job within ten miles is displayed to the user.
## Email Controller
In my email controller I would grab the jobId and the user Id and send an email to the employer associated with the jobId
and the user. The email messenger used SendGrid to complete this task. I would just have to fill out the email addressess and
the what the body of the email would look like.
## Job Posts 
I was responsible for creating a feature that allowed organizations to [post jobs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uJqMjiZDXsqw9Dm8q3o2F9OYy70nucmw/view?usp=sharing). This page would allow organizations to post jobs, edit jobs
already posted or delete a job if it had been filled. 
## Job Landing Page
When a user navigates to their landing page, one of the features that was added was a [job filter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l81Cdyfk2J-lR4hYjJmLNseXW_afXwlh/view?usp=sharing) that a user can use that filters
current available jobs by a certain mile radius. When a user applies for a job a [modal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pij-2WfS_-13ofq_p1s3_eYFA2aWcWe6/view?usp=sharing)
pops up with the job info and the option for the user to apply for the job. This apply button sends an email to the employer
and user notifying both of the job interest.
## Login Form
One of my tasks was making a [login page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uSITfWL0T3ZrNWr_-ghq9LioISuP06Bq/view?usp=sharing).
The login grabs the email and password input and grabs the user record from the database using this email.
I also decided to include third party OAuth to sign in to the website with a users Facebook or Google account.

These are personal side projects that I'm currently working on to grow and learn more as a developer.
